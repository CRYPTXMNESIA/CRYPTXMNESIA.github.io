                    <h2>About eepy</h2>
                    <p>I used to work on this old laptop. As it got older, it really struggled to shut down or restart—probably because of bloat, or maybe just <em>Microsoft, I guess</em>. Every time I needed a quick restart, I'd either wait a fuck ton of time for no apparent reason or because of some update (with even more bloatware that nobody asked for). So, I decided I had to make something that fixes this problem. That's why I made <strong>eepy</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Have you ever tried to shut down or restart your PC, only to get stuck waiting for updates? Annoying, right? With <strong>eepy</strong>, you can skip all that nonsense and instantly shut down or restart your computer—no surprises, no waiting.</p>
                    
                    <p>This tool is super lightweight—just 4.50KB—and it works offline. You don't need to install anything; just download and run it. Whether you're on an older version of Windows or the latest, eepy works smoothly and does exactly what you need.</p>

                    <p>eepy is 100% safe and secure. No malware, no adware—just a simple tool. Because it's so small and compressed, some antivirus programs might flag it as suspicious. These are <strong>false positives</strong> due to the lack of a digital signature, which can be expensive.</p>
                    <p>You can verify this by checking the official <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f590b993b74f803bcad225b840195fb92b6d8f8eaabcfb1df8337b9e2f7d1e4a" target="_blank">VirusTotal report</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Why eepy Isn't Open Source</h2>
                    <p>eepy isn't open source for a few reasons. First, I'm a bit insecure about my coding skills, but more importantly, I'm worried that people might misuse the code, claim they made it, or even alter it in ways that could cause harm. It's a personal project, and I want to keep it simple and safe.</p>
                    <p>I understand if you're concerned about closed-source software. I've been a victim of malware myself, so I know the feeling. But I promise, I have no <span class="easter-egg">ulterior motives</span>. I built eepy to help people, nothing more.</p>
